## 1 Introduction

# Dissecting the composition of non-malignant cells within a tumor is key to
# understanding the interaction between a tumor and its microenvironment,
# predicting the clinical outcome, and assisting in the selection of therapies.
# In the Application Note, [*Characterization of the Tumor
# Microenvironment*](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/application-notes/),
# we showed how the Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling Solution was applied
# to a colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor and a squamous cell non-small cell lung
# carcinoma (NSCLC).

# The bioinformatics community is also actively developing software to analyze
# Chromium Single Cell data, which meet the needs for customized secondary
# analysis towards various biological questions. Here we show how the [NSCLC
# data](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets) can be
# analyzed in R with [Seurat](http://satijalab.org/seurat/) and
# [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/), which are two
# popular packages for single cell gene expression analysis. Through this
# analysis, we show how to apply Seurat and Monocle to 10x Genomics data, how to
# link gene expression with immune receptor sequencing data for the same single
# cells, and how to communicate results from different packages/analytic
# modules.

## 2 Clustering cells

### 2.1 Load 10x data as a Seurat Object

# We started with the filtered gene-barcode matrices files from the outputs of
# [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger).
# The files used in this tutorial are available
# [here](http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-vdj/2.1.0/vdj_v1_nsclc_5gex/vdj_v1_nsclc_5gex_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz).
# They have already been downloaded and extracted into the local directory. Cell
# Ranger also provides a set of raw matrix files which include UMI counts from
# both cell and background barcodes. When dealing with highly heterogeneous
# samples (e.g. tumor samples), it is important to examine whether the default
# cell-barcode calling method is optimal (see [Cell Ranger
# AlgorithmsOverview](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview)
# for details). The raw matrix files could be useful when some cell barcodes
# appear to fall below the cutoff.

# We start by loading the matrix data as a Seurat object. The Seurat function
# `CreateSeuratObject` also allows for filtering out cells and genes with too
# many zero-UMIs. In this step, 13,463 (40%) genes and 212 (2.7%) cells were
# filtered out.
library(tmetutorial)
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
library(Matrix)
library(formatR)
# Load the NSCLC dataset, we've distributed this with R.
gex.data <- Read10X(data.dir = tmetutorial::getSingleCellDataPath())
# Keep all genes expressed in >= 3 cells. Keep all cells with at least 100 detected genes.
gex <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = gex.data, min.cells = 3,
                            min.features  = 100, project = "nsclc_5gex")

### 2.2 Standard workflow in Seurat

# The steps below encompass the standard workflow for cell clustering analysis
# based on scRNA-seq data in Seurat, including selection and filtration of cells
# based on QC metrics, data normalization and scaling, detection of highly
# variable genes, dimension reduction, graph-based clustering, and cluster
# visualization. For more details of Seurat workflow, please refer [Seurat's
# tutorial on 10x PBMC data](http://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html).
# In this tutorial, we only highlight parameters that are customized for tumor
# microenvironment (TME) analysis.

#### 2.2.1 Data normalization

# Here, we plot the distribution of number of genes and UMI counts per cell, and
# fraction of UMIs mapping to mitochondrial genes.

mito.genes <- grep(pattern = "^MT-",
                   x = rownames(x = gex@assays$RNA), value = TRUE)
percent.mito <-
  Matrix::colSums(gex@assays$RNA[mito.genes, ]) /
  Matrix::colSums(gex@assays$RNA)

gex <- AddMetaData(object = gex, metadata = percent.mito,
                     col.name = "percent.mito")
VlnPlot(object = gex,
        features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mito"), nCol = 3)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
FeatureScatter(object = gex, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mito")
FeatureScatter(object = gex, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA")

# Based on the plot, we set cutoff to remove cells with abnormal metrics.
# Considering the high heterogeneity of the TME, we allow a wide range of number
# of genes/UMIs per cell. In this case, 287 out of 7,590 cells were filtered
# out. number of filtered cells

sum(gex@meta.data$nFeature_RNA > 8000 | gex@meta.data$percent.mito > 0.2)
gex <- FilterCells(object = gex, subset.names = c("nFeature_RNA", "percent.mito"),
                     low.thresholds = c(100, -Inf),
                     high.thresholds = c(8000, 0.2))
gex <- NormalizeData(object = gex, normalization.method = "LogNormalize",
                       scale.factor = 1e4, display.progress = FALSE)

#### 2.2.2 Detection of variable genes across the single cells

# Instead of using all genes, focusing on variable genes increases
# signal-to-noise ratio of the downstream analysis. We here used the
# Seurat-suggested parameters for UMI data that are normalized to a total of 1e4
# molecules, which identified 3199 variable genes.

gex <- FindVariableFeatures(object = gex, mean.function = ExpMean,
                           dispersion.function = LogVMR,
                           mean.cutoff = c(0.0125, 3),
                           dispersion.cutoff = c(0.5, Inf),
                           # x.low.cutoff = 0.0125,
                           # x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5,
                           # do.plot = FALSE,
                           verbose = FALSE)
length(x = gex@assays$RNA@var.features)

#  We adjusted the parameters to generate different numbers of variable genes
#  (2000-4000), and ran the downstream analysis. This resulted in similar cell
#  clustering patterns (not shown here). The number of genes needed will vary
#  depending on the sample, and it will often be helpful to adjust the
#  parameters based on a prior expected degree of heterogeneity and variation of
#  the cells in the sample.

#### 2.2.3 Dimensional reduction

# Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for linear dimensional reduction.
# Here, we select to compute 100 principal components (PCs) instead of the
# default 20 PCs. Using more PCs allows the identification of small clusters
# within a heterogeneous sample.

gex <- ScaleData(object = gex, vars.to.regress = c("nCount_RNA", "percent.mito"),
                   verbose = FALSE)
gex <- RunPCA(object = gex, npcs = 100, features = gex@assays$RNA@var.features)

# The heatmaps below show the 3 top, middle and bottom PCs.

PCHeatmap(object = gex, dims = c(1:3, 48:50, 98:100), cells = 500,
          balanced = TRUE)


# Next, we determine the statistically significant principal components.
gex <- JackStraw(object = gex, dims = 100,
                   verbose = FALSE, num.replicate = 10)

gex <- ScoreJackStraw(object = gex, dims = 1:100,score.thresh = 0.1)

# The `JackStrawPlot` function in Seurat provides a visualization tool for
# comparing the distribution of p-values for each PC with a uniform distribution
# (dashed line). 'Significant' PCs will show a strong enrichment of genes with
# low p-values (solid curve above the dashed line). In this case PCs 1-58 are
# all significant and the first insignificant PC is PC59.

JackStrawPlot(object = gex, dims = 1:60)

# Next, we viewed the plot of the standard deviations of the principal
# components with `PCElbowPlot` and try to find a cutoff. We selected the first
# 50 PCs to be used in the following analysis since it appeared to represent a
# significant portion of variation.

ElbowPlot(object = gex, ndims = 100)

#### 2.2.4 Cluster the cells

# Similar to Cell Ranger, the graph-based clustering algorithm as implemented in
# Seurat's `FindClusters` function was adopted to cluster the cells. The number
# of resulting cell clusters could be adjusted via the parameter `resolution`.
# `resolution = 1` was used here according to the instructions from Seurat. We
# also tried `resolution = 2`, and found four more clusters were divided from
# the `resolution = 1` clusters, but their biological identities were not
# clearly distinguished (data not shown).
gex <- FindNeighbors(gex, dims = 1:100)
gex <- FindClusters(object = gex, algorithm = 1,
                      resolution = 1.5)

# We visualize cell clusters with tSNE.
gex <- RunTSNE(object = gex, dims.use = 1:50, do.fast = TRUE)
TSNEPlot(object = gex, do.label = TRUE)

# We can save the Seurat object, so the analysis can be resumed here without re-running the steps above.
saveRDS(gex, file = "nsclc_tutorial.pc50.noLabel.rds")
# To resume the analysis here, comment the above line and un-comment the line below:
# gex <- readRDS("nsclc_tutorial.pc50.noLabel.rds")

### 2.3 Label clusters

#### 2.3.1 Finding genes that are enriched in a given cluster (cluster biomarkers)

#  We find markers for every cluster compared to cells in all other clusters and
#  only report the genes with higher expression levels within each cluster.
#  `min.pct = 0.25` was used to ensure that the cells in each cluster were well
#  represented by the identified markers.

gex.markers <- FindAllMarkers(object = gex, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25,
                              thresh.use = 0.25, print.bar = FALSE)
saveRDS(gex.markers, "nsclc_tutorial.gex.markers.rds")

# View the top 2 markers for each cluster in heatmap.
gex.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(2, avg_logFC)

#### 2.3.2 Label each cluster based on expression of marker genes

# We take two steps to give each cluster a unique and meaningful name. First, we
# examine the expression of well characterized marker genes to identify major
# cell types that we expect to be associated with tumor samples. In the context
# of the TME, we expect to see tumor cells, lymphocytes (B and T cells) and
# myeloid-derived cells. Here we are looking at B lymphocytes (MS4A1), T
# lymphocytpes (CD3E, CD8A, FOXP3), NK cells (GNLY), and monocytes (CD14,
# FCER1A, FCGR3A, LYZ).

# enable FeaturePlot with cluster identity labels
labelFeaturePlot <- function(object, features.plot, nCol = 2,
                            cols.use = c("grey", "blue"),
                            reduction.use = "tsne", ...) {
  pLabel <- as.data.frame(
    Embeddings(gex[["tsne"]])
  )
  pLabel$ident <- Idents(object)
  centers <- pLabel %>% dplyr::group_by(ident) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(x = median(tSNE_1),
                     y = median(tSNE_2))
  featureList <- features.plot[which(
    features.plot %in% rownames(x = object@assays$RNA)
  )]
  notFound <- features.plot[which(
    !features.plot %in% rownames(x = object@assays$RNA)
  )]
  if (length(notFound) > 0) {
    for (nf in notFound) {
      warning(paste0("Cannot find features: "), nf)
    }
  }
  pdf(NULL)
  p <- FeaturePlot(object = object, features = featureList)
  dev.off()
  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = lapply(p, function(x)
    x + geom_text(data = centers, mapping = aes(label = ident))),
    ncol = nCol)
}

# Expression of known markers
labelFeaturePlot(gex, features.plot = c(
  "MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A",
  "FCGR3A", "LYZ", "CD8A", "FOXP3"
), nCol = 3)

# Second, we try to determine the identity of each cluster within the main
# types, based on genes specifically expressed in the cells within each cluster.
# The ideal marker genes should show a clear difference of fractions of cells
# expressing them within different clusters. Based on prior knowledge, a proper
# cluster name representing cellular identity is determined for each cell
# cluster. This is a laborious process, which may not always lead to a
# well-studied cell type, but with a great potential for interesting
# observations and discoveries. Here, we show the identification of Exhausted T
# cells as an example. Based on the expression of CD3E and CD8A, we know
# Cytotoxic T cells should be among Clusters 3, 11 and 18. Then we check the
# genes that are specific to these clusters.

gex.markers %>%
  filter(cluster %in% c(3, 11, 18) & pct.1 - pct.2 > 0.5) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  top_n(5, avg_logFC)

# CXCL13 is a marker for Exhausted T cells ([Zheng et al,
# 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.035)). It was expressed in 79%
# of cells in Cluster 18 but <2% of the rest of the cells. We then view the
# expression of CXCL13 as well as other well-known markers for Exhausted T
# cells, CTLA4, PDCD1 and TIGIT, and they all support the identify of this
# cluster as Exhausted T cells.

labelFeaturePlot(object = gex,
                 features.plot = c("CXCL13", "CTLA4", "PDCD1", "TIGIT"))

# In this case, we iterated this procedure to the other individual clusters, and
# the cluster identities and their marker genes were listed as below. We
# assigned biologically meaningful names to clusters that were well-defined by
# marker genes (e.g. T helper cells). For the other clusters, we assigned the
# names by adding 1-2 of their marker genes to broader, well-defined cell types,
# and also provided related literatures that showed functional roles of these
# marker genes in cancer.

# 2](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release) is one of the popular
# packages developed to address this problem. As an example, we use Monocle 2 to
# analyze the trajectory of T cell exhaustion.

# To define genes that order the cells along the trajectory, we need to first
# identify the cells that represent the different states. These cells could be
# harvested from multiple experiments in different conditions (e.g., time
# points, cultured medium) that align to the presumed trajectory. For cells
# collected in a single experiment, as in this case, some clusters could
# represent cells in different states under proper assumptions. Because we
# already performed cell clustering analysis above, rather than starting over
# from the original 10x gene-barcode matrix, we import the Seurat object to
# Monocle using the function `importCDS`.

### 3.2 Inferring cell trajectories

# As shown above, the exhausted T cells were CD8 positive, so their earlier
# states could present as cytotoxic T cells. Thus, we identify genes that were
# differentially expressed between cytotoxic T cells and exhausted T cells as
# markers for exhaustion. The exhausted T cells which showed specific expression
# of several marker genes (outlined above),  could be considered as a more
# homogeneous population than cytotoxic T cells, which were more likely a
# mixture of T cells in terms of exhaustion state. Therefore, by applying
# `only.pos = TRUE` in `FindMarkers`, we only use genes that were specifically
# enriched in exhausted T cells to order the cells. Although we did not compare
# T helper cells with regulatory T cells (Tregs), they formed a branched
# trajectory apart from the branch of exhausted T cells, consistent with the
# observation that some T cell exhaustion markers (eg. CTLA4, PDCD1) were also
# expressed in the Tregs cluster.

## 4. Analysis of the immune repertoire

# The 10x Genomics Single Cell Immune Profiling Solution allows the clonotypes
# of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B cell immunoglobulins (Ig) from the same
# sample to be determined, which enables us to trace the lineages of the immune
# cells. In this case, the corresponding TCR and Ig clonotype data can be
# obtained from https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets. We can
# then intersect the repertoire sequencing data with the gene expression data.

### 4.1 TCR clonotypes

# We load the T cell clonotype data from the
# [`*filtered_contig_annotations.csv`](http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-vdj/2.1.0/vdj_v1_nsclc_t/vdj_v1_nsclc_t_filtered_contig_annotations.csv)
# file. The clonotypes were annotated by Cell Ranger and unique clonotype IDs
# were assigned. We then counted the frequencies of cell barcodes for each
# clonotype and examined the identities of cells supporting the TCR clonotypes
# shared by multiple cells. The cells in the GeX and V(D)J data was linked by
# the cell barcodes, which consists of a 16-nt string and a GEM group number
# including a in both GeX and V(D)J data.

# In this case we noticed that:

# * Most of the expanded clonotypes were CD8+ T cells, especially exhausted T cells
# * Most of the expanded clonotypes were within single cell types
# * The same clonotypes were shared between regular and exhausted T cells
